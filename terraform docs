create access key & secret key in aws (iam-user-terraform)

-----------How to create(provision) resources in aws
google "terraform proider" -> https://registry.terraform.io/browse/providers --> select AWS -> copy Use provider content

C:/terraform

vi provider.tf

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "5.75.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "aws" {
  # Configuration options
}



google -> terraform aws <resource name> resource  -> ex: terraform aws ecr resource
https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ecr_repository


vi main.tf            (extension should be .tf only)

resource "aws_ecr_repository" "ecr-resource" {
  name                 = "devops-ecr"
  image_tag_mutability = "MUTABLE"

}


where:  
aws_ecr_repository    --> preconfigured resource 
ecr-resource          --> resource type
name:                 --> name of the ECR (required category)
image_tag_mutability  --> optional


terraform validate         ---> just validate the file


Q. why terraform is famous?
Q. Diff between terraform and other provisioning tool(cloudformation/ansible/azure arm template/chef/puppet etc)??
Q. How can we check the output before creation the resources?

ans:  
terraform plan:   Show changes required by the current configuration

***we can generate the output of plan command & send it for approval
terraform plan -out abc.json
